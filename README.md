# machine-learning-deep-learning

This repository showcases my work during my Data Science graduate studies, focusing on:

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests (RF)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - ect.
- **Deep Learning:**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Computer Vision applications
  - GAN
  - ect.

Feel free to explore and use these code examples for your own learning and projects!
