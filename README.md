  - Unstructured data preprocessing (text, image)
- **Data Exploration:**
  - Correlation
  - Statistic Summaries
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Barplot, Boxplot
  - Histogram
  - Correlation plot
  - Scatterplot
  - Density plot
  - ect...
  - Statistical Summaries   
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests (RF)
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - ect...
- **Deep Learning:**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Computer Vision applications
  - GAN
  - ect...
